# Quantum Scheduler
Quantum Scheduler is an AI-driven scheduling tool that leverages the power of quantum computing to optimize caregiver assignments based on availability, preferences, and working hour limits. By utilizing quantum algorithms, the tool efficiently handles complex scheduling problems, providing solutions that are faster and more effective than classical methods.

Quantum Scheduler automates the scheduling of caregivers based on their availability, preferences, and working hour limits. This tool uses advanced quantum-inspired algorithms to optimize caregiver assignments and ensure regulatory compliance.
Key Features:
Quantum Computing-Powered Scheduling: Quantum Scheduler uses quantum algorithms to find optimal caregiver schedules, solving highly complex problems that would be difficult for traditional algorithms.
Automated Optimization: Automatically assigns caregivers to shifts based on availability and preferences, while adhering to working hour regulations.
Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with labor laws, including daily and weekly maximum working hours.
Efficient Problem Solving: Quantum computing accelerates the solution-finding process, offering higher efficiency and accuracy for large-scale scheduling problems.
