for a scheduling problem with 7 shifts and 10 tasks:


|Method              | Runtime (Estimate)     |  Optimality                                 |
| -------------      | -------------          |------------                                 |
| Quantum Annealing  | ~1–5 seconds per run   | Near-optimal                                |
| Genetic Algorithm  | ~10–30 seconds per run |Approximate-optimal (depends on iterations)  |
